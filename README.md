This project is designed to develop and simulate a real-time system dedicated to traffic monitoring within a tunnel. Its
primary goal is to optimize traffic flow and enhance safety for all participants.

Here's an academically toned English translation for your GitHub README:

The simulation was conducted on both the Arduino Mega 2560 board, using the FreeRTOS library, and the Debian Xenomai Linux
platform, utilizing the C/POSIX API. The selection of these environments was motivated by their provision of all essential 
mechanisms for synchronization and communication between tasks, including generalized semaphores, mutexes, timers, and conditional 
variables.
